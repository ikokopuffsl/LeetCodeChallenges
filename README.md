Keep track of the Leet Code Problems we have finished and see how we each approached the problem.

Structure of repo.

problem#-name-of-problem

Example.

1-two-sum
 - kwan.js
 - yaejin.py
 - heeyeon.c

Maybe we can make branches and put up a PR everytime we submit our solution. 
This way we can be notified when someone finishes the problem.
